I'm creating a C# based notes widget for windows, that reads the TXT files in a selected folder and displays them as a list, click in one and loads it as a full note to either read or edit. 
Right now its work in progress and its not compiled, but in the project if you do in a terminat ''dotnet run'' you can test it. 
More soon.
